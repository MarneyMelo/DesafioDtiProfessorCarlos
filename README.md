# DTI Digital Challenge - School Management

---

## About the Project
This repository contains my implementation for a challenge proposed by **dti**.  
The project focuses on processing **student grades and attendance**.

---

## Prerequisites
- .NET SDK 8.0 or later (tested with .NET 10.0.102, realeased on January 13, 2026)
- Any OS supported by .NET (tested on W11)
- Recommended IDE: Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code (tested on Visual Studio)

---

## How to Run 
1. Clone the repository:
```bash
https://github.com/MarneyMelo/DesafioDtiProfessorCarlos.git
```
2. Navigate to the project folder.
3. Run the aplication: 
```bash
dotnet run --project gradeManagement
```

---

## Input Format
- The application expects one student per line, following the format:
 `Name_Student Grade1 Grade2 Grade3 Grade4 Grade5 Attendance%`
- Data entry ends when the user input -1.

---

## Example

### Input
```
Joao 8 7 9 10 6 85%
Marney 10 9 8 7 6 95%
Pedro 5 6 5 4 6 70%
-1
```

### Output
```
Joao 8 85%
Marney 8 95%
Pedro 5 70%
8 7 7 7 6
Joao, Marney
Pedro
```

## Project Structure

The project follows the **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**, where each class has a specific purpose.

```

## Technical Decisions

### Assumptions
- **Names:** Student names are expected to be a single string without spaces.
- **Grades:** Its assumed that all students have exactly 5 grades. 

### Architecture
- **Service Pattern** was adopted to isolate logic from input/output.
- The `Program.cs` serves as the entry point, handling user input and output
- The `Student` class represents all properties and data of each student.
- The `GradeCalculator` class is responsible for all calculations, improvig modularity, testability and maintainability.

### Data Processing
- **System.Globalization** is used to ensure consistent parsing of decimal values.
- Input parsing is protected with exception handling to avoid application crashes due to invalid input.

## Tests

The project includes a suite of unit tests to ensure the integrity of business rules and mathematical calculations. They were implemented to guarantee that the system has a expected behavior.

#### How to run tests:

1. Open a terminal in the solution root folder.
2. Run the command:

```bash
dotnet test

```

#### Scenarios covered:

* **Calculation Accuracy**: Validating class averages per subject.
* **Filtering Logic**: Ensuring students with attendance below 75% are correctly identified.
* **Performance Evaluation**: Verifying the logic for students performing above the class average.
* **Edge Cases**: Handling empty student lists to prevent application crashes.

## Project Status
The current version focuses on the core business logic. Although a frontend in React was listed as desirable, I prioritized the robustness and architecture of the back-end to ensure a solid code. I had not worked with React before, but I had already started studying it during this period.
